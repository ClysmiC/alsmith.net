	<h2>Hi, I am Andrew L. Smith - Programmer</h2>
	
	<h4>In a hurry? Just read the bold and the bullet points.</h4>

	<p>
	  I'm a <strong>22 year-old college student</strong>
	  from <strong>St. Louis, Missouri</strong>, studying <strong>computer
	    science</strong> at <strong>Georgia Institute of Technology</strong>. I
	  started programming when I was 14, learning how to make
	  simple 2D games with a program called Game Maker. I
	  started taking CS classes at 16 and have been trying to
	  learn more ever since. <strong>Most of my work experience is
	    software development</strong>, but I have been exposed to a lot
	  more than that in my class and personal
	  projects-- <span><strong><a id="sampleLink">check them
		out.</a></strong></span> <!-- span to keep on 1 line -->
	  Or look
	  at <span><strong><a href="https://github.com/clysmic">my
		github!</a></strong></span> I only started using github a few
	  years ago, so it doesn't have all my projects but I am
	  trying to add to it as I work on new things!
	</p>

	<hr>
	
	<p>
	  Here is a quick run-down of what <strong>languages I have
	    worked frequently with</strong>:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Java (+ Android Programming, + Processing)</li>
	  <li>C</li>
	  <li>C++</li>
	  <li>C#</li>
	  <li>Python</li>
	  <li>GLSL</li>
	  <li>x86 assembly</li>
	  <li>GML</li>
	  <li>Javascript (+ JQuery, + Ext JS)</li>
	  <li>HTML / CSS</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  <strong>Technologies</strong> that I have used often:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Windows</li>
	  <li>Git</li>
	  <li>Emacs</li>
	  <li>XNA/MonoGame</li>
	  <li>Modern OpenGL</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  And an assortment of <strong>languages and technologies that I have use
	  to varying degrees in classes</strong> (but haven't used too
	  frequently or recently). The higher on this list, the more
	  comfortable I am with it:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Linux</li>
	  <li>SQL</li>
	  <li>Visual Studio</li>
	  <li>MSVC</li>
	  <li>Subversion</li>
	  <li>Unreal Engine</li>
	  <li>MIPS assembly</li>
	  <li>ARM assembly</li>
	  <li>Windows Batch Scripting</li>
	  <li>VHDL</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  Lastly, here are some <strong>random things</strong> about
	  me that may or may not be of interest:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>I played baseball for 11 years. After that, I umpired
	    for 5.</li>
	  <li>I've been using the Dvorak keyboard since 2007.</li>
	  <li>I can
	  eat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saltine_cracker_challenge">six
	      saltines in a minute.</a></li>
	  <li>I love video games. They are a big part of what got me
	  interested in computers (and subsequently, programming)--I'd
	  love to work on one professionally one day.</li>
	  <li>I use emacs!</li>
	  <li>I'm a die-hard St. Louis Cardinals fan.</li> 
	  <li>I do a crossword puzzle almost every day.</li>
	  <li>I can beat an intermediate board of minesweeper in under 30 seconds.</li>

	    <h2>My Favorite Projects</h2>

        <p>A selection of some of my favorite school and personal
        projects that I have worked on, with links to source code
        included. Most of the source code for these projects (among
        others) is on <a href="https://github.com/ClysmiC">my
        github</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="projectTitle">Nintendo 64 Controller mbed Interface</h3>

        <p>
          A library written in <strong>C++</strong> that allows
          an <a href="https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/">mbed
          LPC1768 microcontroller</a> to use a Nintendo 64 controller
          as an input device. I wrote the source code that runs on the mbed itself, while my project partner wrote the code to interface between the PC and the mbed and display the buttons that are pressed.

        <h3 class="projectTitle">Tiger-to-MIPS Compiler</h3>
        <p>
          In my compilers class, we were given a specification for an
          extremely simple programming language called "Tiger."
          Throughout the course of the semester, we wrote a full
          compiler in <strong>Java</strong> to compile Tiger source
          code to MIPS assembly. This is the largest project that I
          have written single-handedly. It uses a table-driven scanner
          and parser to construct a parse-tree, then passes over the
          tree to perform semantic checks and output IR, and then uses
          naive register allocation to translate the IR into MIPS
          assembly. There are likely some bugs in it, not all of the
          design decisions were the best, and it doesn't support
          recursive function calls... but it is a working compiler!

		<h3 class="projectTitle">MLB Live Scoreboard</h3>
		<p>
		  A personal project that I wrote to run on a raspberry
		  pi. This <strong>Python</strong> program fetches data about
		  any MLB baseball game on any date, including live games. It
		  also retrieves local weather data, and division standings,
		  and displays them to a connected screen.

        <h3 class="projectTitle">Ray Tracer</h3>
        <p>
          A 3D ray tracer written in <strong>Java</strong>
          using <a href="https://processing.org/"><strong>Processing</strong>.</a>
          Scenes were read in from .cli files using a format specified
          by <a href="pdf/raytracer.pdf">the assignment
          description</a>, and rendered via ray tracing. The ray
          tracer can render triangles and spheres, and supports
          shadows, reflections, and diffuse, ambient, and specular
          lighting.

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/ClysmiC/raytracer/">Source Code</a></li>

        <h3 class="projectTitle">CSub Subtitle Player</h3>
        <p>
          CSub is a standalone subtitle player that I wrote as a
          personal project my Sophomore year of college. It was
          written as a <strong>Java</strong> GUI, using the Swing library. It is ideal
          for watching videos online that do not support
          subtitles. Simply download the .srt file for the video you
          are watching from a place
          like <a href="http://subscene.com">subscene</a>, load the
          .srt into CSub and sync the player up with the video.

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/ClysmiC/CSub/">Source Code</a></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>I wrote this code before I knew anything about best
          software practices. If I were to write it today, I would
          never tie that much functionality to the various interface
          components. However, I include it on this page because it is
          the first big personal project I ever completed, and
          something that I still use very frequently.</p>
